So first I downloaded the backup file we agreed upon in class on wednesday. 

I imported the file and print it out. It's too big so is summarized in the notbook with rows and columns replaced by dots.

I went to the orginal notebook and saw how to print out the just the column names, so I did that.

I was most interested with types of relationships in the family types studied such as Opposite sex marraige, same sex marraige and unmarried.

I used the code that was in the notebook you pointed us to to build "freq" for FKINDEX column (which is explained in the codebook that you linked.

I imported labels from the original codebook after I learned how to set them.

I then made a bar graph representing the data. I learned that same sex marraiges are way more frequent in this sample then anything else. I was surprised by the disparity of gay marriages as I didnt expect there to be only 1/100th of the opposite sex. I now have to wonder where this sample was done because I dont know how representative it is of our country.
